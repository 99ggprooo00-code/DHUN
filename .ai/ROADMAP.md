# ROADMAP — live status

Rules (permanent, from the user):
- **CURRENT ACTIVE TASK goes at the very top** — file worked on, last
  error, exact next step.
- Mark **exactly** which steps are complete. **Done = pushed + CI green +
  (where the phase says so) on-hardware verified.** Unpushed or
  CI-unverified work is NOT done, no matter how good it looks locally.
- Update this file every phase and every session.

## CURRENT ACTIVE TASK (updated 2026-09-05, session arena/01a070b3-dhun)

**Branch:** `arena/01a070b3-dhun` at local commit `8669e09` (Phase 13 Android
native-polish code; **not pushed and not CI-verified yet**). The previous
pushed baseline is `7ca2f5d`; CI run `33958287878` is green through shared
tests, Android debug build, and Desktop/probe compilation. PR #13 remains
OPEN. The current `test` pre-release is healthy: run `33952291659` passed
`apk`, `msi`, and `publish`; all four rolling assets are present.

**User 2026-09-05 directive — status:**
1. **Release verification — DONE (CI + GitHub release):** `dhun-test.apk`,
   `dhun-test.apk.sha256`, `dhun-test.msi`, and `dhun-test.msi.sha256` are
   uploaded and checksum-staged by successful run `33952291659`.
2. **Hardware gates — OPEN:** Android crash/soak/lock-screen/OEM checks,
   Windows tray/close-to-tray/geometry/mini-player/shortcuts/SMTC/MSI
   clean-VM checks, and the Phase 10/11 checklists remain open as recorded
   below.
3. **Icon pass — CODE DONE, CI GREEN:** `DhunIcons.kt` has 24 embedded
   Apache-2.0 Material paths, a common SVG path parser, and accessible
   `DhunIconView`; attribution is in `THIRD_PARTY.md`. The completion-history
   race fix and token polish are included in the green run below.
4. **Raw glyph purge + token polish — CODE DONE, CI GREEN:** shared UI,
   dialogs, catalog, Android/Desktop harnesses, and the desktop mini-player
   use `DhunIconView`; target icon and numeric dp/sp greps are clean. CI run
   `33956457785` passed shared tests, Android debug build, and probe compiles.
5. **SMTC phase 2 — CODE DONE, HARDWARE OPEN:** commit `7ca2f5d` is pushed
   and CI run `33958287878` is green through the Desktop/probe compilation.
   The integration provides guarded WinRT metadata/artwork/playback state and
   a retained base-JNA `ButtonPressed` COM callback, while tray/keyboard
   fallback remains active. Windows media-key round-trip, tray,
   mini-player, and MSI checks remain open; no phase is hardware-done here.
6. **Phase 13 native polish — CODE STAGED, CI/HARDWARE OPEN:** `8669e09`
   adds edge-to-edge safe-drawing insets, saved Android navigation state for
   rotation, static Search/Resume/Library shortcuts with routing, a battery
   exemption rationale, and an 840dp navigation rail with a docked rail
   MiniPlayer. No acceptance item is complete until CI and real-device/OEM
   evidence exist.

**Last error:** local Gradle verification could not start because this
sandbox has no `JAVA_HOME` and no `java` executable; CI remains the compilation
gate.

**Exact next step:**
1. Push `8669e09` (and this roadmap update) to
   `origin/arena/01a070b3-dhun`, then inspect the PR CI annotations.
2. Fix any Android/Compose/XML/API errors; after CI is green, run the Android
   rotation/back-stack/shortcut/insets and 30-minute OEM/background-playback
   checklist on real hardware. Keep all hardware gates open here.
3. Keep the Windows checklist open; then wire the Phase 14 rot-drill and
   release evidence only after Phase 13 code is CI-green. Do not call GA
   complete without hardware logs.

**CI trail (this session, 9 rounds — all in DEBUG_LOG):**
`33941799559`→android media3 APIs · `33942371150`/`33942622916`→
no CATEGORY_MEDIA, artworkData ByteArray · `33943041377`→desktop
round 1 (Long.dp etc.) · `33944244828`→JNA GUID/Memory ·
`33944782718`→JNA platform helpers fragile → self-contained rewrite ·
`33945300702`→JNA 5.17 API + MiniPlayer imports (annotations capped at
10 — harness Color errors were hiding behind the cap) ·
`33945909159`/`33946130860`→harness 12× Long-hex Color ·
`33946527454` (`3cd4bf8`) → **GREEN**.

**Standing sandbox notes:** no local JDK (CI is the compile gate); no
device/adb/display; direct `curl` mostly blocked, `fetch_page` works;
repo can be reset between turns (re-verify + re-push); GitHub token
flaps — "Invalid username or token" = reconnect GitHub in Arena.

## Instruction audit — what the user directed, and where it lives

Everything below is a standing directive from the conversation (kept here
so no session loses it; the user asked on 2026-09-05 that ALL
instructions — future updates, recurring maintenance, repo sanitization —
be stored permanently in `.ai/`).

| # | Directive | Where it's enforced |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Boot protocol:** no code before boot — MASTER_PROMPT → ROADMAP → `git log`; reply = phase summary + exact next step + permission ask. | `.ai/README.md` boot protocol |
| 2 | **"do it accordingly" = execute the documented plan autonomously**, no multiple-choice questions. | Session behavior |
| 3 | **ROADMAP maintenance:** CURRENT ACTIVE TASK at top; exact step marks; **unpushed/unverified = undone**. | Rules block above |
| 4 | **Code-first** (MASTER_PROMPT AI rules): no stubs, no TODOs in production, hardware verification before a phase is done, small commits, update ROADMAP + KNOWN_LIMITATIONS each phase, report stalls (>30 min no progress), ADR before changing a locked decision. | `.ai/MASTER_PROMPT.md` §AI Behavior Rules |
| 5 | **Rolling test release policy** (2026-09-01): exactly ONE release tagged `test`, asset `dhun-test.apk` always that name, every push to main REPLACES it, no version numbers/history for unfinished builds. Stable URLs never change. | `.github/workflows/test-release.yml` (header comment); extended 2026-09-05 with `dhun-test.msi` |
| 6 | **2026-09-05 Phase 1 (critical):** fix MediaController thread violation (ALL controller methods on main/UI thread); background/power-saver resilience across MIUI/HyperOS/OneUI; audio playback audit (InnerTube extraction, seamless playback desktop+mobile). | Done this session: crash fix + FGS/battery (items 1–3 above); audit findings below |
| 7 | **2026-09-05 Phase 2 (docs):** audit ALL instructions from conversation; store them + recurring-maintenance + repo-sanitization instructions permanently in `.ai/` so they survive across agent sessions; DEBUG_LOG with stack traces + solutions. | `.ai/` directory (user's exact words: "put the unnecessary things … into a separate branch `.ai`" — implemented as `.ai/` dir because the session is pinned to one branch; see CURRENT ACTIVE TASK item 4) |
| 8 | **2026-09-05 Phase 3 (builds & releases):** build verification + produce `dhun-test.apk` + Windows installer + GitHub **Pre-Release** with both attached; "zero compilation warnings". Stack mismatch noted & adapted: repo is KMP/Gradle — **no npm/Tauri exists here**; "npm run build" ≙ CI gradle build, "Tauri installer" ≙ jpackage `:app-desktop:createMsi`. | `test-release.yml` (apk+msi → `test` pre-release); warning policy below |
| 9 | **"Also continue doing previous work"** — Phase 12 CI green → merge PR #9 → hardware checklists → SMTC phase 2 or fallback. | CURRENT ACTIVE TASK next steps |

### Audio playback audit (directive item 6c) — findings 2026-09-05

- **Android path:** `DhunStreamCache` (TTL 5h ≈ under YouTube's ~6h URL
  TTL, invalidated on 403) → `ResolvingDataSource` rewrites
  `dhun://track/<id>` at read time; resolver chain is own-client
  WEB_REMIX → VISIONOS → TVHTML5 (ADR-001); ExoPlayer 403-mid-stream
  recovery in `PlaybackGraph` (invalidate → seek → re-prepare, max 2
  retries per track). Wake lock `WAKE_MODE_LOCAL`, audio focus,
  becoming-noisy handled. **Seamless playback** = Media3's own
  prepare-next behavior (unchanged, correct). Gap found & fixed this
  session: none in the stream path — the gaps were the thread crash and
  the FGS absence (items 1–3).
- **Desktop path:** `DesktopDhunPlayer` wraps vlcj (system libVLC) +
  same shared resolver (yt-dlp failover, ADR-001). Known limitation, not
  a defect: vlcj plays one URL at a time; the 500 ms position poll and
  track-transition logic live in the shared player layer. Re-resolution
  on 403 happens lazily on next play press (documented in
  `.ai/KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md` — stream URLs expire, restore is paused).
  No defect found that blocks Phase 12 merge.

### Compilation-warning policy (directive item 8)

"Zero compilation warnings" = CI compiles `:shared:jvmTest` (compiles
shared), `:app-android:assembleDebug` (compiles android + shared android
target), probe step (compiles probe + **app-desktop**). Warnings in those
streams are addressed as they surface in CI annotations; K2/Compose
library-internal warnings that DHUN cannot fix are listed in
`.ai/KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md` rather than papered over.

## Trajectory to Phase 30 (beyond the locked 14)

The locked plan ends at Phase 14. The user (2026-09-05) asked for the
trajectory all the way to Phase 30. The pool is the original 30-phase
vision (`.ai/PROMPT_SEQUENCE.md` audit) minus what 01–14 already cover.
**These are candidates with a suggested order — NOT designed, NOT
stubbed, NOT scheduled** until the user picks them (Doctrine: no
"later" code).

| # | Candidate | Why this slot |
|---|---|---|
| 15 | **Android native polish finish** (Phase 13 leftovers: app shortcuts, Robolectric/UI tests, tablet two-pane, 30-min soak with LeakCanary) | Same platform as the crash/FGS work just done; cheap while context is warm |
| 16 | **Audio cache (bounded LRU) + offline replay of cached tracks** | Phase 14 item pulled forward; user-visible value, no new surface |
| 17 | **Rot-drill GA** — wire `tools/playback-probe` into the daily cron (replacing the placeholder), auto-issue on red, 24h detection contract live | The Doctrine's maintenance leg; must exist before any public distribution |
| 18 | **Release v0.1.0** (signed debug-keystore APK + AAB, jpackage installers, CHANGELOG, README build docs, tag, GitHub release) | Phase 14; gates everything "real" |
| 19 | **Web/PWA evaluation** (the big deferred item; hard gate: PO tokens/SABR block third-party browser streaming — see `.ai/PROBLEMS_AND_FIXES.md` P7) | Only after the kill-switch data from 17 exists; probably "no" |
| 20 | **Android Auto** (media app on the platform; needs a stable media session — just built) | Natural once 15+18 done |
| 21 | **Cast** | Same dependency as 20 |
| 22 | **Equalizer** (Android: `AudioEffect` platform EQ; desktop: libVLC audio filter) | Feature, no platform risk |
| 23 | **Cross-device sync** (experimental; local-first DB design must survive) | Explicitly experimental in the prompt |
| 24 | **Optional cookie sign-in** (unlock age/region + personal playlists; treated as experimental) | High ToS/legal sensitivity — ADR required first |
| 25 | **Downloads beyond cache** (bounded, offline library) | Extends 16 |
| 26 | **Widgets** (now-playing / quick-play Android widgets) | Session foundation now exists |
| 27 | **Windows jump lists + tray polish** | Phase 12 leftovers |
| 28 | **Themes beyond dark-first** (accent system, light theme) | Design system is token-ready |
| 29 | **Store releases** (Play Store AAB + Windows store MSI, real signing) | After 18 proves the pipeline |
| 30 | **v1.0 GA** — soak on both platforms, RISK_REGISTER review, docs finalized, tag | The finish line |

Ordering constraints: 17 before any public build; 18 before 19–30
anything user-visible; 24 requires its own ADR + user sign-off; 19's
likely outcome is a written "no" — that is also a valid completion.

---

## Recurring maintenance & repo sanitization (standing, permanent)

- **Extraction rot:** rot-drill red → pin last-good, adopt upstream patch,
  patch release ≤72h (`.ai/RISK_REGISTER.md`). Datacenter-IP rot
  (CI-only reds) handled per the KNOWN_LIMITATIONS note.
- **Each phase:** ROADMAP (this file) + `.ai/KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md` +
  `docs/verification/NN-*.md` + small commits.
- **Repo sanitization:** no secrets/device data/credentials in the repo;
  sanitized fixtures; `THIRD_PARTY.md` complete; no build output committed.
- **Rolling release:** `test` tag replaced, never appended; stable URLs.
